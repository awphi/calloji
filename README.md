# MonoRaw
MonoRaw (originally Calloji). An attempt at a robust, slim online monopoly game built in Java.
Originally I had planned to create something much larger but as the complexities of online games became
apparent I switched to a relatively simple game.  

The default client is written in Java and uses a JavaFX .FXML gui. However, as all requests and responses
to and from the server are in JSON a client could easily be made in a language of your choosing.
